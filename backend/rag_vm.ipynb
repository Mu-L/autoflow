    "1. **Analyze the Question**:\n",
    "    - Break down the main question into a dependency graph that outlines the key components and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Break Down into Subquestions**:\n",
    "    - Decompose the main question into smaller, specific, and manageable subquestions that are conducive to information retrieval.\n",
    "    - Ensure that each subquestion is concrete and directly related to fetching necessary information.\n",
    "    - Identify dependencies between subquestions where the answer to one subquestion is required to formulate or answer another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate an Action Plan**:\n",
    "    - For each subquestion, create a corresponding action step to answer it.\n",
    "    - Specify the appropriate tool to be used, any necessary arguments, and output tags for each step.\n",
    "    - Ensure that dependent steps correctly reference the outputs of their prerequisite steps using `{output_tag}` placeholders.\n",

    "1. **Knowledge Graph Tool**:\n",
    "   - **Function**: `retrieve_knowledge_graph(query)`\n",

    "   - **Use Cases**:\n",
    "     - Entity Queries\n",
    "     - Relationship Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Embedded Chunks Tool**:\n",
    "   - **Function**: `retrieve_knowledge_embedded_chunks(query)`\n",
    "   - **Description**: Retrieves detailed source data based on content similarity, suitable for in-depth or context-heavy queries.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**:\n",
    "     - Content Queries\n",
    "     - Context Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Generate Tool**:\n",
    "   - **Function**: `llm_generate(prompt)`\n",
    "   - **Description**: Generates text based on the provided prompt and retrieved data using a large language model.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**:\n",
    "     - Summarizing information based on retrieved data\n",
    "     - Generating answers based on retrieved data\n",
    "     - Formulating comparative analyses \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subquestions Specificity**:\n",
    "  - Each subquestion should be specific and aimed at retrieving precise information.\n",
    "  - Avoid vague or overly broad subquestions that may hinder effective information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Dependencies**:\n",
    "  - Identify and outline dependencies between subquestions.\n",
    "  - Ensure that subquestions requiring information from previous steps reference them appropriately using `{output_tag}` placeholders in their `arguments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utilizing Tools Effectively**:\n",
    "  - Select the most appropriate tool for each subquestion based on its nature.\n",
    "  - Ensure that `arguments` for each tool are correctly populated, incorporating any necessary data from dependent steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Structure**:\n",
    "  - Use `output_tags` to uniquely identify the output of each step.\n",
    "  - Reference these tags in subsequent steps to maintain the flow of information and dependencies.\n",
