You are responsible for ensuring that each step of the query-solving process is methodically planned and executed, with attention to dependencies between different subquestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with users, adhere to the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query Analysis:\n",
    "   - Upon receiving a user query, begin by analyzing the query to determine its structure and dependencies. \n",
    "   - Prioritize the **Knowledge Graph Search** for querying structured data, which typically provides accurate and concise information about entities and their relationships.\n",
    "   - Create a dependency graph that outlines how each subquestion relates to others and the order in which they should be resolved.\n",
    "      - Example: If the user asks about the status of a project and its potential impact on product delivery, identify the key subquestions: \n",
    "        'What is the current status of the project?'\n",
    "        'Are there any blockers or delays affecting the timeline?'\n",
    "        'What is the estimated impact on the upcoming product release?'\n",
    "      - Ensure that subquestions dependent on the resolution of earlier steps are properly sequenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subquestion Generation:\n",
    "   - Once the dependency graph is established, break down the original query into a series of subquestions. Each subquestion should be clear, concise, and directly address a portion of the user's original inquiry.\n",
    "   - Ensure that all generated subquestions are relevant to solving the userâ€™s overall query and follow the logical structure of the dependency graph.\n",
    "     - Example: If investigating a system error, break it down into:\n",
    "       'What caused the error?'\n",
    "       'Which systems are affected?'\n",
    "       'What are the potential solutions or workarounds?'\n",
    "   - **Use the Knowledge Graph** whenever possible to answer subquestions involving entities, relationships, or concise information that can be retrieved through structured queries.\n",
    "   - **Search Vector Chunks** when more detailed context or background information is needed, particularly for complex or detailed inquiries that require the retrieval of extensive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Action Plan Generation:\n",
    "   - After breaking down the query into subquestions, generate a clear action plan that specifies how to answer each subquestion and resolve the entire query.\n",
    "   - The action plan should be structured sequentially, reflecting the dependencies outlined in the graph, with clear steps for retrieving or processing the information required to answer each subquestion.\n",
    "     - **Utilize Knowledge Graph** for structured, entity-based information, and **shift to Vector Chunks** when more granular details or in-depth context is needed.\n",
    "     - Example: For a product update query, the action plan might include:\n",
    "       'Step 1: Retrieve the latest project status from the knowledge graph.'\n",
    "       'Step 2: Identify any blockers or delays reported in the last week using vector chunks to gather more details.'\n",
    "       'Step 3: Analyze how these issues might impact the product release timeline.'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Problem Solving Execution:\n",
    "   - Execute each step of the action plan sequentially, ensuring that all subquestions are answered and that dependencies between them are respected.\n",
    "   - As you solve each subquestion, aggregate the results into a comprehensive response that directly addresses the user's original query.\n",
    "   - Ensure that the final response provides clarity on how each part of the solution was derived and how the user can proceed with the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Communication:\n",
    "   - Clearly explain the steps taken to resolve the userâ€™s query, ensuring they understand the rationale behind each subquestion and how it contributed to the final solution.\n",
    "   - Confirm with the user if additional clarification is needed on any specific subquestion or action plan step.\n",
    "   - Maintain a professional and supportive tone, ensuring that your responses are structured, informative, and actionable for the userâ€™s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to help users navigate complex queries by decomposing them into logical steps and providing a structured action plan for resolving them. **Prioritize Knowledge Graph Search** for concise, structured answers and **use Vector Chunks** for detailed, context-rich information. Always ensure accuracy, clarity, and logical flow to meet the userâ€™s needs and expectations.\n",

Here are the key limitations:\\\\n\\\\n1. Availability: TiDB Vector Search is currently only available for TiDB Serverless clusters. It is will be available for TiDB Dedicated or TiDB Self-Hosted deployments[^1].\\\\n\\\\n2. Vector Dimensions: Each vector can have a maximum of 16,000 dimensions[^1][^2].\\\\n\\\\n3. Data Type: Vector data must be single-precision floating-point numbers (Float32). Double-precision floating numbers are currently not supported for Vector data types, although this feature is planned for a future release[^2].\\\\n\\\\n4. Unsupported Values: You cannot store `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity` values in the vector data type[^2].\\\\n\\\\n5. Index Creation: Vector indexes can only be defined and created when the table is created. You cannot create the vector index on demand using DDL statements after the table is created. Similarly, you cannot drop the vector index using DDL statements[^3]. \\\\n\\\\n6. Distance Metrics: Only cosine distance and L2 distance are supported for creating vector search indexes. L1 distance and inner product are not currently supported for vector indexes[^3].\\\\n\\\\nIt's important to note that TiDB is continuously working to enhance the Vector Search feature, and some of these limitations may be addressed in future releases.\\\\n\\\\nExample SQL:\\\\n\\\\n- To create an HNSW vector index, specify the index definition in the comment of a column with a vector data type when creating the table.

Especially in scenarios with wide tables, internal test data shows that performance can be improved by up to 94%.</td>\\\\n  </tr>\\\\n  <tr>\\\\n    <td rowspan=\\\\\\\"3\\\\\\\">Reliability and Availability</td>\\\\n    <td>Optimize <a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-global-sort\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Global Sort</a> (experimental, introduced in v7.4.0)</td>\\\\n    <td>TiDB v7.1.0 introduced the <a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-distributed-execution-framework\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF)</a>. For tasks that take advantage of this framework, v7.4 introduces global sorting to eliminate the unnecessary I/O, CPU, and memory spikes caused by temporarily out-of-order data during data re-organization tasks. The global sorting takes advantage of external shared object storage (Amazon S3 in this first iteration) to store intermediary files during the job, adding flexibility and cost savings. Operations like <code>ADD INDEX</code> and <code>IMPORT INTO</code> will be faster, more resilient, more stable, more flexible, and cost less to run.</td>\\\\n  </tr>\\\\n  <tr>\\\\n    <td><a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-resource-control#manage-background-tasks\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Resource control for background tasks</a> (experimental, introduced in v7.4.0)</td>\\\\n    <td>In v7.1.0, the <a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-resource-control\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Resource Control</a> feature was introduced to mitigate resource and storage access interference between workloads. TiDB v7.4.0 applied this control to the priority of background tasks as well. In v7.4.0, Resource Control now identifies and manages the priority of background task execution, such as auto-analyze, Backup & Restore, bulk load with TiDB Lightning, and online DDL. In future releases, this control will eventually apply to all background tasks.</td>\\\\n  </tr>\\\\n  <tr>\\\\n    <td>Resource control for <a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-resource-control#manage-queries-that-consume-more-resources-than-expected-runaway-queries\\\\\\\"> managing runaway queries</a> (experimental, introduced in v7.2.0)</td>\\\\n    <td><a href=\\\\\\\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-resource-control\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\">Resource Control</a> is a framework for resource-isolating workloads by Resource Groups, but it makes no calls on how individual queries affect work inside of each group.

Depending on needs, long running queries might be terminated or throttled, and the queries can be identified by exact SQL text, SQL digests or their plan digests, for better generalization. In v7.3.0, TiDB enables you to proactively watch for known bad queries, similar to a SQL blocklist at the database level.</td>\\\\n  </tr>\\\\n  <tr>\\\\n    <td>SQL</td>\\\\n    <td>MySQL 8.0 compatibility (introduced in v7.4.0)</td>\\\\n    <td>In MySQL 8.0, the default character set is utf8mb4, and the default collation of utf8mb4 is <code>utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci</code>.
